## Welcome to my GitHub page!
I am a small, indie even, bilingual dev with a dream - breaking into F1 as a data analyst.  
I might, just might open streams/youtube page for my progress, stay tuned.

### Who am I?
I am Ersin — real name — a computer engineering student in Turkey.  
I have a mission to be the worlds first data analyst as a Turkish person for F1.
Yes, my GPA is enough, yes I know this is a hard dream - stop thinking about it.
